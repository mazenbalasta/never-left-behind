     typed up the Jobs migrations table and the queries and router to have the backend finished and ready for frontend work. Finishing the Tables and queries along with the post, put, get, and delete functions for Jobs completes the MVP of our backend looking now towards handling the frontend and possibly starting on the APIs.

    Looked into alchemy and created roles with PUT, POST, and GET method to try and assign roles to respective groups i.e. Veterans, Business, and Partners. had to update requirements.txt file to get it implemented correctly and added some routes for the Roles table created. Added new installs as well on the virtual env to keep the libraries up to date.
