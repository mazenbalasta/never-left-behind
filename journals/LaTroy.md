     typed up the Jobs migrations table and the queries and router to have the backend finished and ready for frontend work. Finishing the Tables and queries along with the post, put, get, and delete functions for Jobs completes the MVP of our backend looking now towards handling the frontend and possibly starting on the APIs.
